msgid "Frequently there are multiple paths between two given stations. Cargodist will saturate the shortest path first, then use the second shortest path until that is saturated and so on. Saturation is determined by an estimation of capacity and planned usage. Once it has saturated all paths, if there is still demand left, it will overload all paths, prefering the ones with high capacity. Most of the time the algorithm will not estimate the capacity accurately, though. This setting allows you to specify up to which percentage a shorter path must be saturated in the first pass before choosing the next longer one. Set it to less than 100% to avoid overcrowded stations in case of overestimated capacity."
